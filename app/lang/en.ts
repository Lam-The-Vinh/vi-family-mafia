    "The Vi Family, one of the most powerful mafia families from Sicily, Italy, has built a powerful underground empire over many years. Founded by Le Vi, the family is not only famous for its power and brutality, but also for its complex and skillful organization. Under Le Vi's leadership, the Vi Family maintains great influence not only in Sicily, but also in other countries. Below are the key members of the Vi Family, with their roles adjusted to reflect the changes in the family's strategy and operations.",
  contentSuTroiDay:
    "Initially, the Vi Family was just a small gang in Sicily, surviving by smuggling weapons and drugs. However, through Le Vi's intelligence and the absolute loyalty of its members, the organization gradually eliminated rival gangs, expanded its territory across Europe, and reached the United States. Under the iron fist of Ti Vi, every opposition was wiped out without a trace. Trieu Vi transformed the Vi Family into a hidden financial empire, controlling the global money laundering network. Ha Vi, Rut Vi, Lam Vi, Tinh Vi, Lu Vi, Trieu Vi, Sa Vi, Sot Sieu Vi, Co Vi, and La Vi are the monsters that strike fear into their enemies. They not only kill but also erase entire bloodlines of traitors.",

  leViDescription:
    'In the underworld, some are powerful through force, some are wise through intellect, and some are feared for their cruelty. But Lê Vi had them all. He is the creator of the Vi Family, the one who laid the foundation for one of the most powerful mafia organizations. No one knows exactly where Lê Vi came from. Some say he was the son of a long-established criminal family in Sicily, while others claim he was a mercenary who learned every survival rule before building his own empire. One thing is agreed upon: Lê Vi is no ordinary man – he is a living legend in the underworld. He may not be the first to pull the trigger, but he decides who lives and who dies. He rarely appears, but every decision he makes can shift the balance of power among gangs. In the Vi Family, no one dares to challenge Lê Vi. Because anyone who does… ceases to exist to tell the tale. "I don\'t need to be intimidating. Those who truly understand me are already dead."',

  tiViDescription:
    "If Lê Vi is the brain of the Vi Family, then Ti Vi is the iron fist that maintains order and discipline within the clan. As the second in command, he holds absolute power when the Godfather is absent. Whether or not Lê Vi is present, Ti Vi's authority is never challenged – because he is not one to be challenged. Emotionless, unwavering, and without mercy, Ti Vi is known as a ruthless executor, a cold-blooded killing machine. He rarely speaks, nor does he need to threaten – just hearing his name is enough for traitors to know they have no way out. \"If you see my face, it means you don't have much time left.\"",

    "In a world full of cold-blooded individuals, Hạ Vi is the only rose. But don't be fooled by her seductive appearance – Hạ Vi is no ordinary woman. Raised amidst bloody purges, she learned to kill before she learned to love. She is the top assassin of the Vi Family, specializing in eliminating traitors or high-value targets. Hạ Vi never acts conventionally – she enjoys toying with her prey, driving them to despair before sending them to hell. Not only is she skilled with every kind of weapon, but she is also a master of toxins, capable of turning an assassination into a perfectly natural death. A smile from Hạ Vi can captivate men, yet it may also be the last thing they see before their final breath. \"My dear, don't worry... I promise to make your death beautiful.\"",

He lives by one rule: 'No one deserves a second shot.'

Thanks to his genius for disguise, he can infiltrate any organization, manipulate opponents from within, or cause enemies to self-destruct without direct action.

And in the Vi Family, Triệu Vi is the one who controls the entire arsenal of the clan. He is not merely a gun merchant. He holds the key to war, deciding which gang holds power, which organization is armed, and which faction is erased from the underworld map. In the shadows, he is not just an ordinary arms dealer. He is the 'weapon kingpin', capable of turning a group of thugs into a fighting force, and can ignite wars with a single timely shipment. Without Triệu Vi's weapons, an entire mafia empire could collapse. But with him, the Vi Family never runs out of firepower. \"I don't sell guns. I sell power.

Sa Vi is that figure. He is neither a cold-blooded assassin like Hạ Vi, nor an arms dealer like Triệu Vi, nor a hacker like Lâm Vi. Sa Vi exists in the interstice of these worlds – a phantom that no one can trace, yet can find anyone. If the Vi Family wants to track down a traitor, Sa Vi has found them before they even plan to flee.

    'One of the most dangerous and unpredictable members of the Vi Family. No one knows where Cô Vi comes from; it is only known that whenever she acts, chaos ensues. Unlike Hạ Vi who directly kills, not as cold-blooded as Rút Vi, nor as ruthless as Sa Vi, Cô Vi possesses a unique ability: to incite widespread panic. Wherever Cô Vi goes, chaos follows: economies collapse, governments are thrown into disarray, and citizens are terrified. Instead of direct attacks, Cô Vi sows fear, causing enemies to self-destruct without the Vi Family having to intervene. "I don\'t need to kill you. I just need to drive you insane."',
